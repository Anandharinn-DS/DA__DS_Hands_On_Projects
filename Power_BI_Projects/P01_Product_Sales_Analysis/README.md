# 📊 PO1_Product Sales Analysis (Power BI)

## ⭐ Project Summary

**Situation:**  
A business needs to understand its product sales performance across regions, categories, and time periods to make data-driven decisions (e.g., increase revenue, optimize inventory). This project uses transactional sales data to uncover key business insights.

**Task:**  
Build a **Power BI dashboard** that transforms raw sales data into meaningful KPIs, interactive visuals, and strategic insights for stakeholders.

**Action:**  
I performed the following steps:
1. **Data Ingestion & Preparation**
   - Loaded raw dataset into Power BI.
   - Cleaned and transformed the data using **Power Query** (remove duplicates, fix data types, format dates).
   - Created relationships between tables to form a proper data model.  
   - Applied **DAX measures** for key metrics.
2. **Data Modeling**
   - Built a star schema using fact and dimension tables to optimize performance.
   - Used calendar tables and category tables to enable slicers and time analysis.
3. **Visualization Design**
   - Created interactive dashboards with charts and slicers.
   - Focused on KPIs like total sales, profit, sales by product category, and regional breakdowns.
   - Designed for drill-through and filter interactions.
4. **Insights & Business Implications**
   - Identified top-selling products, best/worst performing regions, & seasonal trends.
   - Delivered insights via visuals that support strategic business decisions.

**Result:**  
The final Power BI report enables users to interactively explore sales performance and derive actionable insights, facilitating improved planning and decision-making.
